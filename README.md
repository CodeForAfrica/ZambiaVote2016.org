# ZambiaVote2016.org

This repo is the website for Zambia's deployment of the GotToVote toolkit ahead of the country's national elections, available at ZambiaVote2016.org.

The initial deployment focuses on the "find my polling station" and "verify my registration" modules in the GotToVote.cc toolkit. Later deployments will include the "who is my candidate?" and "election results" modules.

The deployment is led by a local coalition of Zambian civic watchdog NGOs, Triple V, with technology support from Code for Africa and funding from HiVOS and the Open Society Institute of Southern Africa (OSISA).
