        <h3>Engaging the Electoral Process</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Zambia Election Situation Room (ESR)</strong> is an initiative that provides a platform where Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) collaborate on elections observation, monitoring, rapid response and proactive advocacy. This form of collaboration makes efficient use of resources and enhance CSO members’ capabilities to ensure a transparent, fair and peaceful tripartite election in Zambia.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ESR</strong> comprises of: the Steering Committee; the Expert Team; the Technology Team; the Data Officers and Observers, all of whom facilitate the operationalisation and management of data collection; analysis of information coming from the field, provide early warnings of problems, and immediate  recommendations to ensure the credibility and success of the electoral process and coordination with other stakeholders, namely: ECZ; Security Personnel; Political Parties; and the International Community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the ESR combines election observation with real-time analysis and rapid response mechanisms for emergencies, to ensure that the election process is conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner in the eyes of the people.
